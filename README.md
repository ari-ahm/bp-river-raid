# :D
just a fun project that I made as my bp project

# Compiling
It's only been tested on ubuntu but so far I haven't encountered any bugs so it should be fine on macos and maybe even windows...
You'd have to install SDL and SDL_ttf and SDL_image before compiling this.
After that it would be just as simple as ```make```
